# Maria's Mainpage

## Tech Stack

This project is bootstraped from Create-React-App

Deployed by Firebase



## Roadmap & Problems
1. Use Firebase to host the site directly
	> Firebase is blocked in Mainland
	> The domain is not that good
2. Get a new domain and connect with Firebase hosting

## **Proposed Next steps**
1. Host on AWS or GCP, with optimized image URL(CDN enabled)
2. Use Gatsby to do the SEO(!important)
